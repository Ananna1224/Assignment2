          qualifying win over Argentina, feels he needs a break after a long and hard season for club and country.

        <h3>Mauro Icardi</h3>
        <p>
          Icardi has generally found it difficult to find a spot in La Albiceleste's squad. He would have fancied his
          chances this time around given that Sergio Aguero has played less than 600 minutes of league football.

          However, it was the 32-year-old who got the nod for their upcoming qualifying fixtures, signaling that Icardi
          is not in Lionel Scaloni's plans. Icardi is unlikely to make it to Copa America 2021.

          Uruguay’s record.

          Di Maria scored Argentina’s solitary winner in the 22nd minute of the final clash after Rodrigo De Paul’s
          through pass caught the Brazil defence napping. The PSG star won the man-of-match award, while Messi claimed
          the Golden Ball award.

          It has been widely reported the Reds had refused to release Salah and Galatasaray had also done so for Mostafa

          The 22-man squad, named by under 23 coach Shawky Gharib on Friday, included Al-Ahly goalkeeper Mohamed
          El-Shennawy, Ittihad's Ahmed Hegazy and Zamalek's Mahmoud al-Wensh.

          The Turkish club are taking part in July's Champions league play-offs against PSV Eindhoven.

          The Pharaohs qualified for Tokyo's Games after their U-23 AFCON triumph in 2019.

          They are in Group C, playing alongside Argentina, Spain, and Australia.

          Barcelona midfielder Philippe Coutinho will not play for Brazil at this year's Copa America after undergoing
          another knee surgery, according to national team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar.

          "I can say that he will not recover in time for the Copa America," Lasmar told Globoesporte.com.

          Coutinho, 28, underwent surgery in early January to repair a torn meniscus and had another operation Monday on
          the same left knee.

          Barcelona did not reveal how much time he would miss, but Lasmar effectively ruled him out for the rest of the
          season.

          the
          Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro came in the 22nd minute after Rodrigo de Paul made a long pass to Angel di
          Maria. The 33-year-old veteran striker counted on some sloppy defending from left-back Renan Lodi to take
          control and lob it past goalkeeper Ederson. It was only the third goal Brazil conceded in the tournament.
          Neymar tried hard with dribbles and passes, but the Selecao barely threatened Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano
          Martinez.
